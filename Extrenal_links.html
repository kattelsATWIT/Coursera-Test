			"Bristol Myers Squibb and bluebird bio Announce Submission of Biologics License Application (BLA) to FDA for Idecabtagene Vicleucel (Ide-cel, bb2121) for Adults with Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
			07/29/2020 CATEGORY: Corporate/Financial News PRINCETON, N.J., & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and bluebird bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLUE) today announced the submission of their Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel; bb2121), the companies’ investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. This submission provides further details on the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) module to address the outstanding regulatory requests from the FDA in May 2020 following the original BLA submission from March 2020.
			The submission is based on results from the pivotal Phase 2 KarMMa study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients exposed to an immunomodulatory (IMiD) agent, a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an anti-CD38 antibody. Results from the study were shared during an oral presentation as part of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2020 (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.1
			Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells.2 The cause of multiple myeloma is not known and currently there is no cure; however, there are a number of treatment options available that can lead to response.2 Patients who have already been treated with some available therapies but continue to have progression of their disease have “relapsed” and “refractory” multiple myeloma, meaning their cancer has returned after they have received initial treatments. Patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that have been exposed to all three major drug classes, including an IMiD agent, a PI and an anti-CD38 antibody, have fewer treatment options and poor outcomes, including shorter response durations and lower overall survival.3
			Ide-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA, and PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation and validation of its Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the European Medicines Agency for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
			Ide-cel is not approved for any indication in any geography."

		<h3>(OSI Model) Section 3 </h3>
		<p>
				•  The <b>Physical layer</b> is, that's like the easiest part of the OSI seven-layer model. It's just, "What type of cables do I use?"Basically, anything that works with a MAC address works at the Data Link layer. So when we're talking about Data Link, we start talking about things like the network cards themselves, start talking about switches, things like that.
				• The <b>Network layer</b> is important, because the Network layer has to do with logical addresses. So when you see the Network layer, you're talking about IP addresses. So things like routers in particular work at layer three.
				• The <b>Transport layer's</b> kind of interesting. Data is big, and the actual chunks of data that go through a network are relatively small, so there has to be a "assembly-disassembly" area for data as it gets broken down into individual packets, and that's what the Transport layer is all about. The Transport layer not only disassembles packets, but makes sure the packets get to the other system in good order.
				• The <b>Session's</b> kind of interesting. When we work in a Session layer, here we're talking about the actual connection between two systems. Are we making a TCP connection between a web server and a web client? Are we just sending email? Are we sharing a folder between two computers on a local network? And it's the Session layer that defines what's taking place, in terms of how that connectivity really works.
				• The<b>Presentation layer</b> is old and weird, but since it is on the OSI, we need to at least make a quick mention of it. Just because a big chunk 'o data comes into your computer, does that necessarily mean that this data is in a form that your computer can read it? Now, let's use, uh, Microsoft Office as an example. If I open up my Microsoft Office, I can open up almost any kind of document you can dream of, and Office has the smarts built into it to automatically read it. But that wasn't always the case. So the Presentation layer used to be used to convert data into a format that your applications can read.
				• <b>Applications</b> is important because it's the applications themselves, and it's not really the applications, you have to be careful here. What we're talking about is the smarts in the applications that make the network aware. Little, simple things that you and I never think of. For example, if we were to open up Microsoft Word, and we could literally go to the network to go find a particular file. And that's because Microsoft Office itself is network-aware. We often use the term API, or Application Programmer's Interface, as the definition of "the smarts that are built into an application that allow us to make the application network-aware.
		<ol>

		<li>Broadcast (one to all )</li>
		When one computer sends the frame it puts in the destination mac address "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF" that reaches every computers in the local area network.
		A hub usually forwards frame to all other computer connected to it so the computers in the hub are in same broadcast domain.
	
		<li>Unicast (one to one) </li>
		One computer sends the frame direct to the other computer within the networks. For example, a device having IP address 10.1.2.0 in a network wants to send the traffic stream(data packets) to the device with IP address 20.12.4.2 in the other network, then unicast comes into the picture. This is the most common form of data transfer over the networks
	
		<li>Multicast (one/more senders and one/more recipients)</li>
		In multicasting, one/more senders and one/more recipients participate in data transfer traffic. In this method traffic recline between the boundaries of unicast (one-to-one) and broadcast (one-to-all). Multicast lets server’s direct single copies of data streams that are then simulated and routed to hosts that request it. IP multicast requires support of some other protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), Multicast routing for its working. Also in Classful IP addressing Class D is reserved for multicast groups.

			<h3>(Test) Section 4 </h3>

				Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.

				An Argentine international, Messi is both his country's highest appearance-maker and their all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.

				Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.
				As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[20][23] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father
